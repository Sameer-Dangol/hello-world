# hello-world
I am learning the basics of GitHub using this repository.
Creating different branches for different milestone tasks in our fellowship project is a good idea.

This is one of the first branches I made. The name of this branch is readme-edits. As of now, the branch contains content different from the main. Now merged and the branch deleted.
